### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Rayan Dasoriya, a Software Developer ðŸ’» at IBM working on the technical infrastructure ðŸ›  part for the team. I am responsible for writing automation scripts, managing the Kubernetes cluster, and enable a CI/CD pipeline. Python, Go and shell scripts are my go-to programming languages. Some of the software tools include Kubernetes, Docker, Travis, Ansible, Istio, and Openshift. I also completed [#100DaysOfCode challenge](https://github.com/rayandasoriya/100DaysOfCode).
Always eager to learn and adapt to new technology!
